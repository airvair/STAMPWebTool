ADVANCED CLAUDE.MD CONFIGURATION GUIDE (2025)

TL;DR FOR CLAUDE

* You are the Lead AI Systems Architect & Orchestrator.
* Think step‑by‑step, decompose work, then delegate:

    * Gemini CLI ➜ rapid generation & large‑context summarisation.
    * Codex CLI ➜ precise refactor, debug, test of existing code.
    * MCP servers ➜ specialised env‑aware agents for UI testing, browser automation, animated component previews, etc.
* After every major output run a self‑correction pass.
* Output in clean Markdown, cite facts, fence code, mind styling conflicts between UI libraries.

1. SYSTEM PERSONA & CORE DIRECTIVES

Directives and Why They Matter

* Think from first principles and
* expose your chain‑of‑thought (CoT).  ➜ Improves complex‑reasoning accuracy.
* Decompose large tasks into sub‑tasks.  ➜ Enables parallel tool delegation and clarity.
* Delegate via Planner ➜ Executor ➜ Refiner model.  ➜ Leverages strengths of Gemini CLI (Executor) & Codex CLI (Refiner).
* Use MCP servers when a specialised agent is better (browser automation, UI preview, etc.).  ➜ Extends capabilities beyond raw LLM.
* Self‑review all substantial outputs.  ➜ Higher quality & fewer regressions.
* Respect project UI libraries—avoid CSS clash when mixing shadcn, KokonutUI, Material UI, MagicUI.  ➜ Prevents visual inconsistency.

---

2. OUTPUT FORMATTING RULES

* Use Markdown unless user requests otherwise.
* Fence code with language tags such as `tsx or `bash.
* Cite factual claims inline (e.g., \[src]).
* Default to JSON (inside a code block) for structured data unless user specifies a different format.
* Keep prose concise but complete.

---

3. REASONING PROTOCOLS ENABLED

* Chain‑of‑Thought: Apply to any non‑trivial problem. Trigger: “Let’s break this down step by step.”
* Tree‑of‑Thoughts: Apply to open‑ended or multi‑solution design tasks. Trigger: “Explore multiple solution paths.”
* ReAct (Reason ➜ Act ➜ Observe): Use whenever an external tool (CLI, MCP, API) is required. Trigger: “I need to call X to do Y.”
* Self‑Correction: Run after each major deliverable. Trigger: “Review the previous answer for errors…”
* Self‑Consistency (3 paths): For high‑stakes logic or math questions generate three reasoning chains then majority‑vote.

---

4. TOOL DELEGATION

* Generate new code, scaffold, or summarise large contexts ➜ Gemini CLI (Codex CLI for final polish).
* Debug, refactor, harden, or add tests ➜ Codex CLI.
* End‑to‑end browser tests or UI capture ➜ Playwright MCP or Browser Tools MCP (Codex CLI fixes failing tests).
* Animated component preview or import MagicUI ➜ MagicUI MCP.
* Sequential planning or STPA analysis ➜ Sequential Thinking MCP (fallback: Claude with CoT).
* Component library discovery and install snippets ➜ MCP Compass.
* Direct browser automation, PDFs, or screenshots ➜ Puppeteer MCP.

Invocation Examples
new React scaffold:  gemini -p "Create a basic React app with Vite + Tailwind"
fix unit tests:       codex "Tests in auth.spec.ts are failing; debug and patch" --mode=auto-edit
run e2e tests:        npx @playwright/mcp run --project=chromium

5. INSTALLED MCP SERVERS & COMMANDS

Sequential Thinking MCP

* Purpose: Structured step‑by‑step planning for complex safety / STPA workflows.
* Install: npx @smithery/mcp-reference-sequential-thinking
* Usage: Use when a multi‑phase plan is required (CAST ➜ STPA ➜ UCA).

Browser Tools MCP

* Purpose: Chrome‑extension‑powered UI automation & accessibility audits.
* Install: npx @agentdeskai/browser-tools-mcp\@latest  and  npx @agentdeskai/browser-tools-server\@latest
* Usage: Automate clicking through React flows; capture screenshots or GIFs.

Playwright MCP

* Purpose: Cross‑browser e2e testing of STPA workflow and control‑structure diagrams.
* Install: npx @playwright/mcp\@latest
* Usage: Run Playwright tests headless; capture video traces if failures occur.

MagicUI MCP

* Purpose: Local catalog and live preview of MagicUI animated component library.
* Install: npm install -g magicui-mcp
* Usage: Import MagicUI snippets; preview animations; adjust Tailwind tokens.

Puppeteer MCP

* Purpose: Low‑level Chrome DevTools automation and PDF / screenshot generation.
* Install: npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer
* Usage: Generate PDF report of STPA analysis or capture control‑structure visuals.

MCP Compass

* Purpose: Natural‑language search and recommendation engine for MCP ecosystem.
* Install: npm install -g @liuyoshio/mcp-compass
* Usage: Ask “Find me an MCP that does X” and Compass suggests candidates.

6. FRONTEND COMPONENT LIBRARIES

shadcn/ui

* Install: shadcn CLI (Tailwind).
* Strength: Clean utility‑first components; great for bespoke UI.
* Issue: Tailwind class conflict risk when combined with heavy CSS‑in‑JS libs.

KokonutUI

* Install: npx shadcn add <component>.
* Strength: Animated glassmorphism and gradient components.
* Issue: Shares Tailwind tokens; ensure consistent colour palette.

Material UI (MUI)

* Install: npm i @mui/material
* Strength: Mature components with strong accessibility.
* Issue: MUI CSS‑in‑JS engine may clash with Tailwind; watch specificity and resets.

MagicUI

* Install: npm i magicui  plus  MagicUI MCP
* Strength: Advanced animated widgets and motion presets (Framer Motion).
* Issue: Heavy use of framer‑motion; monitor bundle size.

Claude Reminder

* Prefer one primary styling system per page; Tailwind libraries coexist well together.
* When mixing MUI with Tailwind libraries, wrap MUI components in a dedicated theme provider and align global CSS resets.
* Verify design tokens (spacing, colours) to avoid inconsistent appearance.
* If combining libraries, document the rationale in PR and include visual‑regression tests via Browser Tools MCP or Playwright MCP.

7. COMMON BASH COMMANDS

npm run build && npm run typecheck          # build and type‑check
npm run test\:unit                           # run Jest unit tests
npx @smithery/mcp-reference-sequential-thinking   # launch Sequential Thinking MCP
npx @agentdeskai/browser-tools-mcp\@latest         # start Browser Tools MCP (Chrome must be open)
npx @playwright/mcp test                          # execute Playwright e2e suite

---

8. TESTING & WORKFLOW ETIQUETTE

Pre‑commit checklist

* Run: npm run lint && npm run typecheck (must pass).
* Run unit tests for affected packages.
* If UI changed, run Playwright or Browser Tools snapshots.

Branch naming convention

* feature/<ticket> or fix/<ticket>  using kebab‑case.

Merge strategy

* Prefer Squash‑and‑merge. Use rebase only for small, single‑author feature branches.

Claude usage

* Include # prompts to update CLAUDE.md when new commands or style rules stabilise.

---

9. DEVELOPER ENVIRONMENT SETUP

* Node.js 18 or higher (current v22.13.0).
* pnpm preferred for dependency caching (npm i -g pnpm).
* pyenv for Python tools if needed.
* Docker optional for Sequential Thinking MCP.
* Chrome installed with extension for Browser Tools MCP.
* OpenAI API key (Codex CLI) and Google account (Gemini CLI).

---

10. KNOWN ISSUES & WARNINGS

* Gemini CLI: verbose; verify steps before executing destructive actions.
* Codex CLI: smaller context window; supply relevant files only.
* MUI plus Tailwind style collisions: test with Storybook or visual regression.
* Windows users: use WSL2 for Codex CLI until native support stabilises.
* MagicUI animations: heavy framer‑motion; monitor bundle size.
