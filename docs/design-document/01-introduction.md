# Chapter 1: Introduction

## 1.1. Purpose of this Document

This Software Design Document (SDD) serves as the comprehensive technical blueprint for the STAMP Web Tool, a sophisticated web-based application designed to facilitate System-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP) analysis. The document aims to:

1. **Provide architectural guidance** - Define the system's technical architecture, design patterns, and implementation strategies to ensure consistent development practices across the team.

2. **Document design decisions** - Capture the rationale behind key architectural and implementation choices, enabling future developers to understand the system's evolution and constraints.

3. **Establish implementation standards** - Define coding conventions, data structures, and component patterns that maintain system coherence and quality.

4. **Enable knowledge transfer** - Serve as the primary technical reference for onboarding new team members and facilitating collaboration among stakeholders.

5. **Support maintenance and evolution** - Provide the foundation for system maintenance, debugging, and future enhancements by documenting the system's behavior and structure.

This document bridges the gap between high-level requirements and low-level implementation details, ensuring that the STAMP Web Tool is developed with consistency, maintainability, and scalability in mind.
